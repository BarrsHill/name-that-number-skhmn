Name that Number
Telephone Keypads often have letters associated with each number. This means that 0141 117 2556 could be stored as 0141-CAT-DOOR. Create a program that can convert
a phone number with “letters” into one that only contains digits.

Extensions:
1. Can you develop your program so that only words in the dictionary are allowed?
